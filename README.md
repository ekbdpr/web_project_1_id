# web_project_1_id

This is my very first project as a student at Practicum ID.

My name is Eka Budhi Prasetya.

Dan disini saya telah menyelesaikan project saya yang bertemakan "One Page Website".

Seluruh isi dari website ini telah disesuaikan dengan **Sprint 1 ID Brief** dan **Sprint 2 ID Brief** tetapi dengan sedikit _tambahan_ dari saya pribadi.

I added a Comments Section that actually _works_ and you could try it right away !

I said _works_ because i haven't learned about Javascript and Back end so i'm not sure if this will work 100% on a live server.

What's in the Comment section :

1. Form type elements that contains Name, Email and Comment box inputs.
2. A **_Submit_** and **_Reset_** button that also shows pop-up to confirm whether the user really want to reset the form or not.
3. A Comment section which will display your messages on the form.

I also added some javascript codes thats necessary so that the comment section can display what the user writes in the Comment Form

Im using [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to assist me making the JS codes since right now i dont have the knowledge to do so, YET !

I will add some features later on as i progress further on my journey with **Practicum**.
